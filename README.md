# ICT Project

## preparation

We implemented this project initially on `macOS Big Sur 11.6`, but `Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS`should also compatible, which is exactly the platform we plan to port to.

Users can use `apt`  on Ubuntu or `homebrew` on macOS to install the required dependencies.

- `python 3.7.11`
- all the packages required in `requirements.txt`, use `pip install -r requirements.txt`to install them.
- `ffmpeg`
